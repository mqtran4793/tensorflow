1)	First, download the model definition and weights to the “data” directory:
cd examples/
curl –L "https://storage.googleapis.com/download.tensorflow.org/models/inception_v3_2016_08_28_frozen.pb.tar.gz" | tar -C label_image/data/ -xz

2)	Next, create the build directory and compile the program:
cd label_image/
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make

3)	Run the compiled program to do inference. The output shows a list of labels with the probability next to it.
./label_image
